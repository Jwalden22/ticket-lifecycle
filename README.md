I created and worked with a new ticket. I did this by first submitting a new ticket as if I was an employee with a tech issue.

I then logged in as a helpdesk technician to then work the new ticket.  I changed any "Status", "Priority", and or "Assignments" that may apply.

<p>
I then worked the ticket and updated the notes.  That could include being done with and closing the ticket or it could include updating the person who submitted the ticket of any further delays or just keeping up to date as to where we are with a solution.
